# Multi-threaded Simulation of Cyclone

This code solves the nonlinear shallow water equations in a rotating frame.
Here, 3rd order Runge-Kutta method is used for the analytical solution of Shallow water equations.
View cyclones.pdf to look at how the cyclone is likely to propagate over the fabric of sea water.
